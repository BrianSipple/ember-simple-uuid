# ember-simple-uuid

_Direct client-side UUID generation that exposes [node-uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid) as an importable module_.

Original credit for this addon's approach is due to [ember-cli-uuid](https://github.com/thaume/ember-cli-uuid). `ember-simple-uuid` offers the same functionality -- but without any dependency on `ember-data` or initializer decoration of `DS.Adapter`. Those wanting such extra behavior may well want to give `ember-cli-uuid` a look.
